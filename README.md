This project provides an in-depth analysis of bank loan data to uncover trends in loan disbursement, repayment behavior, borrower profiles, and financial risk. It uses SQL for data transformation and Power BI/Tableau for visualization, enabling interactive dashboards and KPIs that assist in data-driven decision-making.

Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Structured and processed raw bank loan data.

KPI Development:
Loan Disbursement by State & Month
Loan Status Analysis (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Defaulted, etc.)
Verified vs. Non-Verified Loan Payments
Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Insights
Home Ownership vs. Loan Repayment
SQL Queries: Designed optimized queries for aggregations and trend analysis.
Interactive Dashboards: Built reports in Power BI/Tableau with filters for state, year, and loan type.
Business Insights: Identified repayment patterns, risk factors, and borrower trends.

Tools & Technologies
SQL – Data querying and analysis
Power BI / Tableau – Dashboarding and visualization
